In the shower there was dirt in the corners Yuck!", "We had an ocean view room which you can still see the ocean and the Boardwalk from. We had a wonderful view of the ocean. Service was excellent, the room was very clean, the view was Unbeatable, and the staff couldn't do enough for us.

The suite layout was perfect for our family of four and while we did not attempt to cook we appreciated the kitchenette. The rooms are warm, spacious with good amenities...the attention to detail in all aspects are commendable.", "The room was exceptionally spacious, the bathroom well stocked with towels, robes and toiletries. The room was on the small side but still comfortable for two people. Free Internet access in the business centre near the hotel bar was great. It was no wonder there was a drain in the middle of the bathroom floor and 2 shower mats provided!", "There was also a small gym and Sauna in the basement. However, the most annoying thing is that the walls are extremely thin so you can easily be disturbed by noise from other guests. This was very Noticable when you returned from the 30+ temperature outside to our room. Considering people are out all hours in Barcelona, this is important if you want to sleep well.", "The room was lovely, comfortable and clean. They were beautiful, clean, elegant, and the bed is comfortable which I am a stickler about. For us, this small inconvenience was outweighed by the other factors. The rooms were small but air conditioned and more than comfortable.", "Room size is not bad for a European hotel. The room was OK - small, not fancy. I could hear the traffic on the street and people outside waiting for lift. The room air conditioning Didnt work.", "The chandelier was beautiful and the room was beautifully decorated. If you take a water taxi from the airport, make sure they drop you at the steps of the hotel. The rooms had numerous exquisite details...small, but comfortable, quiet, and beautiful. The Colombina is a small gem in this magic.", "The room was small, plain, and clean. Comfortable bed and the bathroom facilities were excellent. Located on a quiet street, this is a true gem.

The area that the hotel is in is quiet in the evenings but still has several dining options close by.", "The bathroom had a little wear and tear but there was ample room for toiletries around the sink. Free Internet/Computer in their small business center. Very friendly staff, good service, rooms exactly as on pictures. Our room was amazing, especially for the price.", "The rooms were very comfortable with a Fridge and Microwave. Our room was ready around 11 am, well in advance of the 3 PM Check-In time.

It was great to get away from the noise when we wanted to sleep.", "The room was rather small and the shower almost Unworkably small. The room was tiny. And lies in a quiet street with lots of Resurants near.

I had a couple of small Quibbles.", "The room was small, but since we were are out most of the day, it did not matter much to us.

The room was in the Re-Modeled part of the hotel (our request) and was sleek, modern and clean, although small.", "The room was small but very Managable .. The free cold bottled water in the hallways is a great idea. Rooms are small. The bathroom is a extremely small but updated.", "We had 5 adults in our 1 bedroom suite and there was loads of room. The room was quiet. The kitchen was great, and featured a small Fridge, oven and cook top, as well as utensils. The Murray Hill East suites is exactly what we were looking for.", "The bathroom is beautiful and clean as is the rest of the room. The TV was hidden behind the wall mirror and so had distracting glare. (Bryant Park, dinner, etc ...) the desk clerk was very elegant and even gave us a room upgrade because they didn't have the room I Pre-Booked. We got it for 175 a night on Hotwire...the other hotels I mentioned start their room rates at 399 a night.", "The room was small, but it is what we expected for a room in Paris. The room faced the street, yet was very quiet. The room was tiny and Smelly. The room was Spotlessly clean and the shower was the best.", "The rooms were understated but luxurious and comfortable and our views were fantastic of the Bay. I had a view of the water, which is very interesting and I would recommend it. The bathroom was stunning with a very deep Soaker tub and awesome shower with an overhead rain shower. The rooms are beautiful and definitely worth mentioning, but the true Standout at this property is the staff.", "The pool and hot tub were fun for my son. Our room had no hot water whatsoever. I was staying a few nights with my daughter, asked for a larger room and they accommodated us no problem & no extra charge. Immediately after getting to our room we had a problem---Caused by one of us---That made the room undesirable.", "Go for the ocean view rooms. Also, the rooftop bar called high, had spectacular views of the ocean and city. Having a a walk out terrace with the room was a perk. The balcony with chairs was the best part of all.", "The pools and hot tubs are fantastic. Even in the chilly winter air, it is a mystical and magical place with the steam rising from the Clear-Blue mineral water. The rooms are clean and spacious. Our room was spacious and clean."], "location": ["First and foremost thou are the location location location. The hotel is located 1 block from the Piazza Navona, the most beautiful piazza in all of Rome. It's about a two minute walk away from both Piazza Navona and the pantheon. It was very clean, perfectly situated (within walking distance of most sites) and the staff was so friendly.", "The hotel is in a great location, near subway lines, a short walk to the Spanish steps, and just outside the Borghese gardens. The location is terrific. The Marriott Gran flora is a wonderful hotel. Not a bad hotel at all, and would go back if I were staying with points!", "5 minute drive to anywhere in key West. This hotel was a quick 5 minute, or $4/Person cab ride to Duval St. and dozens of restaurants and pubs. Key West is great! -Good Location-, good access.", "Best of all, it was right on the beach and Boardwalk! Our recent stay at the grand hotel in ocean city, Md was good but not exceptional. You leave the hotel & walk across the Boardwalk & right down to the beach. The hotel is Convieniently located on the Boardwalk with many amenities within the hotel itself.", "Another wonderful stay at this Hotel- can't wait to return! Great location--very short walk to the Metro. The location is superb - right in the heart of old Montreal. After hours of research I decided to go with this hotel due to the outstanding reviews that it got.", "I suggest getting the Hop-On/Hop-Off tour bus pass from the hotel, it's a few Euros cheaper and well worth it. Location is fantastic. I would recommend this hotel. The hotel could not be any more central or better located than it is from both La Ramblas and the shopping.", "The Metro station is near the hotel and we didn't have so many problems. I booked this hotel based on the reviews and was not disappointed. The location was great and the area was quite. Sadly, the hotel came up very far short of our expectations.", "The shuttle to the Spanish steps made all the difference. The service was excellent, and the hotel itself just beautiful. The shuttle service to the Spanish steps was reliable and it was a pleasure to eat out each evening under the moonlight. There was a courtesy car from the hotel to the centre every hour which was great.", "The nearest train station to the hotel is Lepanto which is also around a 5 minute walk. The location was great. We travelled on 21/11 so maybe the hotel was a bit less busy. There are a number of Gelato shops and restaurants nearby.", "If you take a water taxi from the airport, make sure they drop you at the steps of the hotel. The service at the hotel was fantastic. The location is perfect. This hotel was recommended to us by some Travellers we met in the summer.", "We got a Tram from the central station and then a short walk to the hotel.

The location of the hotel is fantastic. Would recommend this hotel. (there is a wonderful, repeat wonderful, restaurant just down the street and around a corner called La Vechia Cava.).", "Great location and close to the Metro station. Restaurants, shops, cafes and Supermarkets all nearby. Parking is conveniently located next to the hotel, and the hotel offers a discount on the parking fees. I knew I was in for complaints from my group about the location of this hotel.", "Great location, walking distance to the French quarter.

We chose this hotel based on the reviews and ranking on this site.", "Should you wish to go around and see Rome, you can take the Metro which is few minutes walk from the hotel.

After extensively researching hotels in the area we decided on the hotel Adriano.", "We took the train from the airport (only $2.25 each) and the hotel was about 5-6 blocks away from where we got off. This hotel was perfect for us! This is a really great find, in a superb location. We got to the hotel to check in, and were very quickly assisted by Tim - who was fabulous!", "Close to Grand central station for the subway. This is the perfect hotel for the New York experience, minus the Hussle and Bussle of the city. Location is decent. A home away from home!", "Midtown location is good on W. 44Th Street between 5th and 6th Aves. The hotel is very Conviently located and even though central, it isn't too close to time square so not full of tourist attractions. This hotel is advertised above 4 stars, but it is 3-Stars at best in my opinion. City club is a small boutique hotel in a great central location in Midtown Manhattan.", "The location was great, being close to the place Monge Metro station. This hotel is essentially average. The Bakery/Cafe across the street was Yummy and there was plenty of restaurants and shops to keep you full and busy. A good location, at a great price for Paris that was clean, with a modern bathroom, and helpful, pleasant staff.", "The location is amazing: just a block away from the Pike market. Location could not be any better. This is not a usually grandiose four seasons hotel. Property is in great location, halfway between the piers, sightseeing and shopping districts (key since it is a hilly city).", "Caught the shuttle to the airport. We will happily do this again rather than dealing with a hotel and different parking facility. They run constant shuttle service to the airport which is what you are looking for. Free parking.", "The location is good (very close to the beach and a Long-Ish walk to Santa Monica). If we came back to Venice Beach hotel Erwin is definitely where we would stay ... Venice is such an awesome place we love it and the hotel is the best!!!! You can't beat the location right next to Venice Beach.", "The location is great and allows walking to all Calistoga spas, restaurants, and shopping. The location is great. I know I've been going to Calistoga for a good 20Yrs. The atmosphere is quiet and relaxed with three different hot pools to relax in."], "service": ["The staff, especially Mike! We found the staff friendly and most helpful after my husband was robbed at Rome train station! The staff were pretty Unhelpful as well. In addition to the lackluster feel of our room, the woman at the front desk was somewhat unpleasant.", "The Concierges were very helpful. The service was top notch. Thank God I got there before my guest because they did not have my reservation. We called the flora and they confirmed they had a room available.", "Ask the hotel staff if unclear. Internet service was excellent. Breakfast was a pleasant surprise with lots of options. Could have been better but Hey, it was no extra charge!", "Upon Check-In, the level of customer service was poor. The staff was courteous and helpful. And note to management: if my car key / remote is found, please let me know (details left with front desk). Whenever we did have an issue, housekeeping and/or maintenance addressed our concerns immediately and efficiently.", "The concierge was great. The service was great: we were expecting a little Snotiness because are Americans but there was none of that. All in all--a very pleasant experience in a wonderfully unique city. Now to the good stuff.", "The staff members were extremely helpful and very polite. Not sure the reception or the postal service was to blame. The discount booklet provided helped save a few Euros on entrance fees. Only one problem.", "It's modern, friendly staff, Swimmingpool, located in best area and the price is also Democratic. However, we didn't complain as it wasn't unbearable and I'm sure it would have been fixed straight away if we had reported it. The staff at the hotel are great and speak good English which if you do not speak Spanish makes things so much easier. The staff were really helpful and knowledgeable.", "The shuttle service to the Spanish steps was reliable and it was a pleasure to eat out each evening under the moonlight. Mario the concierge was incredibly helpful. Everyone is alert and eager to provide you with a great vacation experience. Absolutely pleasant stay!", "This hotel and staff were equally pathetic and an affront to ones senses. Many reviews indicate the front desk staff is rude. The hotel lobby staff was equally as bad. I found the front of House to be all very friendly and helpful, perhaps they were responding to my Cherry disposition.", "Marco at the front desk was very helpful and always willing to recommend restaurants and sites. Most of what I read on trip advisor before booking was true, great location, clean, friendly, great service. They also organised a wonderful trip to Murano for us in a private speedboat for free. Again, if you are travelling with heavy luggage, this is a challenge.", "The staff were always polite and helpful. Friendly service. We asked for a basic Info, she replied she did not know. They have a computer in the lobby where you can surf the Internet for free.", "The staff was also helpful and polite. For the price paid, we really couldn't have asked for more. Internet in the lobby. All in all, it was a very pleasant stay.", "And the staff speak impressive English and are friendly. The staff we found were quite cold and non welcoming. From the very start till we left the staff could not have been more polite and helpful. All in all, we were very pleased with the personnel and the rooms.", "But the staff were very helpful and went out of their way to improve my stay. I could not have asked for better service from Stanley and his staff! And the staff are Super-Friendly and always willing to help in any way. The staff was the best ever based on my previous traveling experiences.", "The staff was very helpful and arranged transportation for us when needed. For regular hours charges is 50 Euro and 70 Euro for (10Pm-7Am) service. Didn't take advantage of the bar Untli the last night but got a Heck of a pour for 3 Euros. Hotel Grifo provided us with 2 fans and they also provide some compensation - the nights cooled down so it was Bearable.", "The staff were wonderful - helpful, courteous and professional. The staff have an excellent level of service and so friendly. After we were Unceremoniously released from our prison, all we were offered was one beverage from the bar and a very terse apology. It was so pleasant to stay away from the crowds of San Marco.", "One, the front desk staff is very unfriendly and not very willing to help. The desk clerks are a bit shy and withdrawn, as they do not speak English well, but that didn't seem to present any major problems. Best part was the bar man who was friendly and very helpful with recommendations for Bars/Places to eat. All my requests have been met with a smile and courteous response!", "The staff was very rude (with the exception of one Lady). Staff was friendly and efficient. The service was also very good and efficient. The Check-In staff were mixed, one very friendly and helpful and the other disinterested.", "I would like to know why the disparity in responses from the staff on this. Maid service was excellent and the front desk was helpful. If management reads this, please respond. The manager was just simply rude.", "The best part of my stay was the service. Staff was friendly and helpful. I was treated like a queen by the staff and Hugo and Lauren were absolutely hotel class and professionalism at its best. The building itself is impressive in decor and Cleanliness, and the kindness of the staff made it really enjoyable and most relaxing.", "The staff was friendly and they spoke English. The staff were friendly and helped us with booking trips etc. Staff was very friendly and helpful. The staff are really friendly and will make calls for you and arrange trips.", "The service is typical four seasons, always there when you need them, with few flaws. The kind where you think if care so genuinely about your stay or if they are just paid to do so. Haley at the concierge was very helpful. The SpA was pleasant, and massage was good like most other four seasons spas.", "They run constant shuttle service to the airport which is what you are looking for. The shuttle driver we had when we returned was very friendly and helpful with our luggage. I am very grateful that he was around as I don't think we would have gotten much satisfaction from the front desk attendant. Once we were seated we waited about another 10 minutes to be served.", "The bartender was very friendly and had some great recommendations of other cool places for us to visit while we were in the area. I'm anxious for the restaurant and room service hopefully. The package that I booked came with a $50 credit at the restaurant. I skipped housekeeping for two days.", "The staff were helpful and friendly and the SpA is for being thoroughly spoiled! Again, no service seems to be the Mantra at the Roman SpA. The staff was very friendly. When we arrived in the early evening we were greeted by their attentive staff and were quite pleased by the reasonable pricing of their rooms."], "cleanliness": ["However, you can't beat the location and the bed was extremely comfortable. It was clean and air conditioned. It is clean and basic accommodation. The only downside was the shower curtain had seen better days.", "But the flora was nice I'll give it that, but not any nicer than the average Marriott property in the States I thought.

Our room was clean, the bathroom was clean. The Marriott customer service Rep. was very nice and helpful.", "Nice hotels in ocean city are just too expensive!

A functional modern bathroom. The rooms are clean, well appointed and modern.", "It wasn't warm enough to use the pool, but it was nice to sit out on the roof with a drink. The hotel was very clean and the rooms were cleaned everyday to the same excellent standard. The room was very clean and the Maid/Housekeeper left my Nightie arranged prettily on the bed like Origami every day. Staff again were great and food and Ambience very nice.", "They were beautiful, clean, elegant, and the bed is comfortable which I am a stickler about. The pool area was nice, but in shade for a large portion of the day; however, the pool restaurant was lovely. The walk is quite pleasant through the park but we were recommended not to do it at night. We booked a King size room however we were given a room with two single beds pushed together.", "The rooms were very nice, clean, and comfortable; no complaints at all. The breakfast was nice. I walked and walked every day and it was really comfortable to stay in Cicerone to reach all those places in a very short time. There was a nice bar and restaurant in the hotel but they were quite expensive.", "The room was Sorta clean and incredibly tiny!

Chamber maids very friendly, and a good breakfast .. They also had the nicest Lani outside of our room that opened up and somewhat extended our room.", "The shower was amazing, and the bed was very comfortable. A really nice breakfast buffet is offered in the restaurant downstairs and service is excellent.

The bedroom had two double beds and the sofa made into a queen sized bed. The bathroom is tiny but clean. Everything was clean and tidy.", "The bathroom is beautiful and clean as is the rest of the room. The beds and linens are also top of the line. Turn down service is a nice touch, that few Pricier hotels would even bother with. Suspect that because of fabric wallpaper, the smell is difficult to get out, but it was Off-Putting.", "The room was Spotlessly clean and the shower was the best. The room was very small, even by Paris standards, although the bed was comfortable. The rooms were very nice and clean, the bathrooms were exceptionally clean and well equipped. The room was tiny and Smelly.", "The bathroom was stunning with a very deep Soaker tub and awesome shower with an overhead rain shower.

The bed was very comfortable. The room was clean and comfortable, as were the beds. The shower drain was Mildewed.", "They don't change you bed, they make up your bed. Nice views from rooftop bar. The outdoor tables though are much better as long as it's a nice day out there. Overall we had a nice stay at the hotel.", "The tables are always clean and so are the pool areas. The rooms are clean and spacious. It's a nice retreat for the whole family. The room was very clean, but the bed was not comfortable and the pillows were too hard."], "building": ["The one negative is its 1ST floor (not ground) location and no elevator. However, the hotel is 1 step up from a Pensione...it is located on the 2ND floor of an apartment building with no elevator. That character was what I was looking for. Bonus: the bottom floor has an ancient fountain and the whole place is built atop an ancient site.", "Breakfast is served on the top floor of the hotel. I was able to enjoy the view of the city while sipping an Espresso. Lobby was nice. Music from bar can be heard at night.", "Beautiful pool area! Lack of elevator in our wing made lugging the suitcases up and down the stairs a chore. The Fairfield was very clean and appeared to be recently remodeled. The grounds are beautiful, and the staff is excellent.", "I liked the indoor and outdoor pool area and the pool bar. We had an ocean view room which you can still see the ocean and the Boardwalk from. The door had no hooks on the back so there was no place to put your clothes. The furnishing are starting to look dated.", "Our room was spacious with a kitchenette, living room, desk with Wireless Internet, and a large bathroom with a shower and soaking tub. The rooms are beautifully decorated with dark wood accents and modern decor. The suite was appointed exactly as you would expect for a boutique hotel. We did not eat any other meals at the hotel, although they have a nice courtyard cafe that would be enjoyable in warmer weather.", "However, once you pass the lobby and go towards the rooms, you come to a tiny lift (only one lift!). The free Internet (and Wifi) was a welcome addition - particularly since our stay coincided with 2 very rainy days! Nice bar downstairs. Free Internet in the lounge area.", "The pool and SpA on the roof looked good but the weather was a bit cool to go in. Bar was beautiful and lobby is very small. Although we did not go in the hotel bar on the ground floor, it looked warm and welcoming. The terrace also has lovely views across the city.", "The pool and garden is fantastic. Beautiful courtyard and great service. This hotel is old first of all, so are the rooms that feel like a three Star or poor 4 Star. The charming Patrick escorted us to our lovely adjoining rooms on the third floor.", "The elevator goes to the 7th floor but our room is on the 8th floor? Yes, just for you, you get to hoof it up a flight of stairs to get to your room. Rooms in the attic were rather small, but comfortable enough, bathroom was also O.K. I personally walked through the 7th floor and no Construction/Repairs were taking place.", "I had been looking for a hotel in Venice that had a balcony overlooking the canal and the room I booked was not a disappointment. The rooms had numerous exquisite details...small, but comfortable, quiet, and beautiful. I can only assume the other two rooms on the 4TH floor are similar but without the terrace. The chandelier was beautiful and the room was beautifully decorated.", "Walls and doors are not sound protected, so if someone talks loudly in the floor hall you can be disturbed and even Woken up. Next, we were advised that Wifi is available entire hotel. They have a computer in the lobby where you can surf the Internet for free.

Got a fantastic room on the 9th floor with a huge balcony with dining table and sofa.", "The area is well traveled and I saw no transients. We had to go to the lobby area to connect. There is parking out the front to unload luggage. You've raised the bar, quality Inn & suites (downtown New Orleans).", "Our family of 4 enjoyed the QUAD room with the terrace (shared terrace but we were the only ones using it). We were in the Annex, just across the street (which is all that was available when we booked). It's in a delightful neighbourhood, which has a lovely Village-Like atmosphere. We were on the top floor.", "The rooms are beautifully decorated and the hotel is very chic. In the reception area, there are one or two computers with free Internet access. The hotel is the first art Deco hotel in Venice and just beautiful. If it had a terrace to lounge on, it would be the best.", "The lobby is fantastic, with a very warm feeling. You had to pay for Internet, but there was a computer in the lobby for use that we never had trouble using. There is also decent free Wi-Fi. I don't think the hotel renovated the rooms on the lower flowers.", "You have to have your key in order to use the elevator. The water bottle filling stations on each floor is also another great feature. It's very tiny & I was on the 17th floor with no view. Our room was on the 21st floor and we had a great view of the river.", "The decor is a little dated, however the room was clean. Internet is free in the lobby but there is a charge to use it in the room. They even had a small area for dining and living room. The gym was small but there was only ever 1 other person using it whilst I was there so there were no problems.", "They don't have a gym, but I think you can pay for a pass to use the NY sports Club nearby. My only complaint is that the tile in the hallway echoes any footsteps that go by your door. The lobby is small and connects to the Well-Rated Db Moderne restaurant, where meals can be taken. The only issue is that the gym pass was not included in the rate if you don't book directly with the hotel.", "My in-laws' room was on the fifth floor. The free Wifi was a Definate plus. The elevator is small but was in good order. My sister's was on the first floor, had 2 twin beds (kind of narrow), and had an even bigger room and bathroom.", "The pool was a hit with the kids, as was the Brownie Sundae by the pool!! The hotel lobby is lovely and the rooms are serene. We had a nice, large room with an excellent view of the water (over the Viaduct and some buildings, as others have noted). The hotel is a new structure, of modest height, right on Seattle \u2019 s waterfront.", "The pool and hot tub were fun for my son. But as mentioned, my fears were unfounded once I opened the door. The facility was older and a bit tired, but quite acceptable. We used this hotel recently and once in the past when flying in and out of Seattle.", "Go for the ocean view rooms. The rooftop bar is without compare in Venice or in Santa Monica. Amazing views from the rooftop bar. The room was great and actually looked nicer than the photos - Funky decor, perfectly clean, cool neon Bathrobes, valet parking...TV, nice bathroom ...", "The pools and hot tubs are fantastic.

The accommodations are so clean and fully equipped, and the grounds so pampered, we always have a relaxing, enjoyable time."], "food": ["The breakfast was coffee, teas, juice and Rolls- enough to get you started. A bonus was the fresh flowers at the front desk. The breakfast was worse than a McDonalds fast food experience. Also fire exits were blocked by breakfast tables.", "The breakfast buffet and the view from the rooftop was incredible! In room Dinning and the Cabiria restaurant had great food and service. The staff was very helpful especially in recommending very good restaurants. Again, the entire staff in the restaurant was very anxious to help in any way that they could.", "This Continental breakfast was amazing with so many wonderful choices. For instance, their recommendations of restaurants and attractions were terrific. There were a few Food/Snack options at the bar, but it was mostly there for drinks. Nice tiles, fresh linen, and clean room.", "Lastly, we ate in their restaurant for breakfast on the first morning there. Restaurants and lounge aren't open and there is no satisfactory food on site. Good kitchen space - Microwave, sink, plenty of cupboards, Refridgerator, coffee maker. There was a refrigerator in the room along with a coffee maker and a variety of coffee packets and vending machines on each floor.", "A Continental breakfast was included in our room. We ate dinner on our last night at the s restaurant in the hotel. This really left us with a bad taste in our mouths in an otherwise wonderful 3-Night stay with no other issues. The location is great for sightseeing, although many of the restaurants nearby are Touristy and mediocre.", "Breakfast was good with sufficient range of offers. However the range of food on offer was fairly good. We also received a bottle of Cava and chocolate from the hotel which was very nice. Everything was clean and tidy and there was a nice fluffy robe and slippers.", "The breakfast was great {my wife Tryed everything! Staff again were great and food and Ambience very nice. Within several blocks of a couple Metro stops, with lots of good restaurant choices within easy walking distance. La Pedrera is a few minutes walk away as is all the higher end shopping Eg Gucci.", "On a brighter NOTE the food is amazing from baby (1 Michelin Star) as well as the grill. Breakfast was best we had in 3 weeks in Europe. Air around the hotel is very fresh and clear. The room was lovely, comfortable and clean.", "The breakfast was plentiful and varied, but not terribly exciting. They also were able to find us places to dine on Christmas Eve and Christmas lunch...both meals in Rome restaurants are traditionally closed. Checked-In hungry at 11:30 p.m., concierge phoned Ambasciatore Di Capri restaurant around the corner to stay open to feed us. Also European-Style cheeses and luncheon meats as well as breads, yogurt, cereal, fruit, juices and Cappuccino.", "The breakfast was plentiful with a good choice of food. We did not have one decent meal which is strange considering there are hundreds of Italian restaurants. The concierge Recomended several good restaurants and one not so great one, but on the whole we were happy. Nice restaurants nearby.", "The breakfast buffet at the hotel is good - healthy and fresh with plenty of choice, but don't expect service with a smile. The selection was very impressive, much better in other Mercures. Eggs were cooked to order. The only downside of the hotel I could see were that they didn't have anywhere to eat or any room service.", "The breakfast was amazing! Must recommend restaurant Paradiso Perduto at Fondamenta de la Misericordia quite nearby. The breakfast room is beautiful--and the selection of food is wonderful. The staff is amazing - the front desk attendant must have spoken at least 4 languages, which was really impressive and useful.", "Our room included breakfast buffet, we all enjoyed it daily, lots of selection and good quality of foods. In business area but did have a few good restaurants nearby with lots of cafes for breakfast. Didn't eat in hotel so can't comment on food. About 1.5 blocks to food market, smaller version of La Boqueria.", "Continental breakfast excellent even included scrambled eggs, sausage and waffles. The breakfast is very good and was more than just Continental. The full breakfast was plentiful and tasty. The breakfast was an absolutely wonderful surprise.", "The breakfast was Suffciant. This included juices, cereals, selections of bread, meat, cheese, yogurt and spreads. Very knowledgeable on the area - great suggestions on restaurants and sites. They are very helpful and give lots of advice about good places to eat and shop.", "The breakfast was very good with everything I could expect and presented well. ), greeted us by name upon our arrival, and recommended wonderful restaurants and destinations throughout our stay. The exchange left a bad taste. The decorations are modern, we were received with courtesy our rooms were prepared on time.", "The breakfast was great for a European hotel. She was very informative and helped me plan a couple side trips as well as point out some great places to eat. It is very central with all major sights and plenty of restaurants within easy walking distance. Its location is excellent, I could walk to all historical sites of Rome, and there are many good restaurants nearby.", "On site restaurant was good as well. Furthemore, we could not even sit in the lounge Aea in the restaurant in the bar because it was rented out. Our granddaughter ordered chocolate milk and French toast. We walked up and down the river walk, to great restaurants and the train is just a block away.", "Plenty of enjoyable restaurants nearby, especially Cibo around the corner. There is also a convenience store on the corner which stocks everything you could need (including umbrella's when we got stuck on a rainy day). We liked the 24 hour Diner, Scotty's, a few steps away. Scotties is a great dinner for breakfast or late night dinner and they deliver to the hotel!!", "They even bring you chocolate chip cookies with turn down service. I told them I did not use the mini bar at all, and they promised a credit without discussion. Warm cookies awaited our return in the evening. Continental breakfast is served in their \"hot spot\" late night bar or directly to your room.", "Breakfast was very nice with bread, Croissants, cereal, milk, cheese, Yoghurt, plus Coffee/Tea/Hot chocolate. Breakfast was a little Cramped with not enough tables for the guests however this was the only real downside. The Bakery/Cafe across the street was Yummy and there was plenty of restaurants and shops to keep you full and busy. Breakfast is served in the basement, nothing fancy but enough to get you going in the morning.", "The food presentation was beautiful and everything tasted perfect. The restaurant was excellent for food and service! Dinner in the art restaurant the following evening in the restaurant was more indifferent. Every detail is covered ..... we ate at art for breakfast and dinner and the food was very good.", "The breakfast was the typical COMP. The restaurant on-site provides good food at a reasonable price. The room was clean and comfortable, as were the beds. We did use the shuttle to get us to the airport.", "The rooftop bar high was the icing on the cake. Food is varied and room service good. We had breakfast there one morning which was great. The Burger was amazing!", "Fantastic wine tasting throughout the area as well. The location is great too because there are several great restaurants within walking distance so no Hassles with cars. We were hoping there would be an ironing board and iron in our room. The hotel is located within walking distance of many restaurants and shops."]}
